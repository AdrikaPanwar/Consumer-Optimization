# Consumer-Optimization

A complete end-to-end **data analysis project** focused on consumer behavior and sales optimization using Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau.

This project explores an eCommerce dataset to draw actionable insights, such as top-selling products, customer lifetime value, and sales trends. The workflow spans from data preprocessing in Python to PostgreSQL querying, Excel validation, and Tableau dashboard visualization.

## Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **PostgreSQL** (data modeling and querying)
- **Excel** (intermediate analysis & exporting)
- **Tableau** (dashboard & storytelling)

- Netherlands and Germany follow with significantly less revenue.

### Top Products
- Products like **"WORLD WAR 2 GLIDERS"**, **"WHITE HANGING HEART T"**, and **"POPORN HOLDER"** are top contributors in quantity.

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Identified high-value customers with revenue above **250K**.

### RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Segmented customers based on shopping behavior.
- Helps in targeting top-tier vs dormant customers.
